This code is primarily a custom UI to trigger ComfyUI workflows using presets and prompt randomization.

## Configuration Options

`gen_order`: A single run can include multiple resolutions, models, vaes, loras, IP adapters, and control nets. Modify the gen_order list to set the order in which these combinations are run.

`redo_parameters`: Redo an image using the stored workflow found in the image, but with desired different parameters.

`model_presets`: For specific models set clip_req and prompt_tags specific to prompt modes or generally.

`prompt_presets`: For specific prompt modes add a chance to prepend or append tokens to the prompt.

`default_negative_prompt`: Any of the defaults are useful, but the negative default can be especially useful as it is often less likely to change.

## Server

Set configuration options for a server port to make use of the server while the UI is running. Calls to the server made with Python's multiprocessing client will update the UI as specified, but leave anything unspecified as already set in the UI. This can be helpful to use in conjunction with other applications that involve images. For an example, see [this class](https://github.com/tomhallmain/simple_image_compare/blob/master/extensions/sd_runner_client.py).
