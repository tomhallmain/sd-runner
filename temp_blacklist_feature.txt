I'll analyze the provided context and help identify potential issues and next steps for the blacklist feature.

From reviewing the code and README, here are my observations:

1. **Current Implementation Status**:
   - There's a UI window (`BlacklistWindow`) for managing blacklisted tags
   - The `Concepts` class has basic blacklist management functions (add, remove, clear)
   - There's a sampling mechanism that attempts to filter out blacklisted concepts
   - The code has a TODO comment indicating the sampling case is "broken"

2. **Potential Issues**:
   - The sampling logic in `_sample_whitelisted` only filters concepts that contain blacklisted tags as substrings
   - The filtering is case-insensitive but preserves the original case in the output
   - The sampling mechanism might not be handling edge cases well (as indicated by the TODO)
   - There's no validation of blacklisted tags before adding them
   - The blacklist is stored in memory and only persisted through `app_info_cache`

3. **Missing Functionality** (based on README requirements):
   - No way to enable/disable tags (as noted in the TODO comment) (done)
   - No validation of prompt weight/relation to undesirable concepts (not possible at this time)
   - No mechanism to prevent prompts with high-weight undesirable terms (done)
   - No way to export/import blacklists (done)
   - No way to categorize or organize blacklisted terms

4. **Architectural Next Steps**:
   - Implement proper validation and sanitization of blacklisted terms
   - Add a more robust filtering mechanism that considers:
     - Exact matches
     - Word boundaries
     - Semantic similarity (using CLIP or similar)
   - Add persistence layer for blacklists
   - Add ability to enable/disable individual blacklist entries
   - Add weight/relation scoring for terms
   - Add import/export functionality
   - Add categorization/organization of blacklisted terms
   - Add logging and monitoring of filtered prompts
   - Add configuration options for filtering behavior

5. **Testing Considerations**:
   - Need to test edge cases in the sampling mechanism
   - Need to test case sensitivity handling
   - Need to test performance with large blacklists
   - Need to test persistence and recovery
   - Need to test UI responsiveness with large blacklists

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or focus on a specific aspect for further analysis?
