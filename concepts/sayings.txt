A day late and a dollar short
Absence of malice
All's lost
All's not lost
Cut through the red tape
Give it to me straight
Keep your secrets
Not so fast!
Not so sure
That is to say
That settles that
Think nothing of it
Up to snuff
Vanish into thin air
You're on thin ice
A blessing in disguise
A dime a dozen
A leopard can't change its spots
A picture is worth a thousand words
A stitch in time saves nine
Actions speak louder than words
All bark and no bite
All's fair in love and war
An apple a day keeps the doctor away
An eye for an eye
As cool as a cucumber
At the drop of a hat
Back to square one
Barking up the wrong tree
Beat a dead horse
Beat around the bush
Better late than never
Better safe than sorry
Between a rock and a hard place
Big fish in a small pond
Bite off more than you can chew
Bite the bullet
Bite your tongue
Break a leg
Break the bank
Break the ice
Burn bridges
Burn the midnight oil
By hook or by crook
By the skin of your teeth
Call it a day
Call it quits
Can't make an omelet without breaking eggs
Catch-22
Close but no cigar
Come rain or shine
Cost an arm and a leg
Cry wolf
Curiosity killed the cat
Cut corners
Cut to the chase
Devil's advocate
Don't count your chickens before they hatch
Don't cry over spilled milk
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Down to earth
Draw the line
Drop in the bucket
Easy come, easy go
Every cloud has a silver lining
Every dog has its day
Every man for himself
Face the music
Fair and square
Fight fire with fire
Find your feet
Fish out of water
Fit as a fiddle
Fly on the wall
For the birds
Get a grip
Get a taste of your own medicine
Get cold feet
Get out of hand
Get the ball rolling
Get your act together
Give someone the benefit of the doubt
Give the cold shoulder
Give it a shot
Go against the grain
Go back to the drawing board
Go down in flames
Go the extra mile
Go with the flow
Good things come to those who wait
Green with envy
Haste makes waste
Have a bone to pick
Have a heart
Have your head in the clouds
Head over heels
Hit the nail on the head
Hit the road
Hit the sack
Hold your horses
I'm all ears
In a nutshell
In hot water
In the same boat
It takes two to tango
It's a piece of cake
It's all Greek to me
It's not rocket science
It's raining cats and dogs
Jump on the bandwagon
Jump the gun
Keep it under your hat
Keep your chin up
Keep your eyes peeled
Kill two birds with one stone
Kick the bucket
Knock on wood
Know the ropes
Last straw
Laugh all the way to the bank
Leave no stone unturned
Let bygones be bygones
Let sleeping dogs lie
Let the cat out of the bag
Let the chips fall where they may
Like a fish out of water
Like two peas in a pod
Live and learn
Long story short
Look before you leap
Make a long story short
Make ends meet
Make hay while the sun shines
Make or break
Method to the madness
Mind your own business
Miss the boat
Miss the mark
More than meets the eye
Needle in a haystack
Never say never
No pain, no gain
No strings attached
Not my cup of tea
Off the beaten path
Off the top of my head
Old as the hills
On cloud nine
On pins and needles
On the ball
On thin ice
Once bitten, twice shy
Once in a blue moon
Once in a blue moon
Once in a lifetime
Out of left field
Out of the blue
Out of the frying pan into the fire
Out of sight, out of mind
Over the moon
Paint the town red
Pass the buck
Pay the piper
Penny for your thoughts
Piece of cake
Play it by ear
Play your cards right
Point of no return
Pot calling the kettle black
Practice makes perfect
Pull someone's leg
Pull strings
Pull yourself together
Put all your cards on the table
Put your foot in your mouth
Put your money where your mouth is
Read between the lines
Red herring
Right off the bat
Ring a bell
Rise and shine
Rome wasn't built in a day
Rule of thumb
Run circles around
Saved by the bell
Scratch the surface
See eye to eye
See the light
Shoot the breeze
Sit tight
Sixth sense
Smell a rat
Smooth sailing
So far so good
Speak of the devil
Spill the beans
Start from scratch
Steal someone's thunder
Stick to your guns
Storm in a teacup
Straight from the horse's mouth
Take a rain check
Take it with a grain of salt
Take the bull by the horns
The ball is in your court
The ball's in your court
The best of both worlds
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
The devil is in the details
The early bird catches the worm
The early bird gets the worm
The elephant in the room
The grass is always greener on the other side
The last laugh
The last straw
The pot calling the kettle black
The whole nine yards
The writing is on the wall
There's no such thing as a free lunch
Think outside the box
Through thick and thin
Throw caution to the wind
Throw in the towel
Time flies when you're having fun
Time is money
Tip of the iceberg
To make matters worse
To each his own
Tongue in cheek
Too many cooks spoil the broth
Turn a blind eye
Turn over a new leaf
Two heads are better than one
Two wrongs don't make a right
Under the weather
Up in arms
Up to scratch
Use your head
Variety is the spice of life
Wait and see
Wake up and smell the coffee
Walk on eggshells
Water under the bridge
Wear your heart on your sleeve
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it
What goes around comes around
When hell freezes over
When it rains, it pours
When pigs fly
Where there's smoke, there's fire
Wild goose chase
Word of mouth
You can't have your cake and eat it too
You can't judge a book by its cover
You can't win them all
Your guess is as good as mine
Zero tolerance
