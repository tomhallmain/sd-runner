Walls have ears
Walnuts and pears you plant for your heirs
Waste not want not
Water under the bridge
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it
Wear your heart on your sleeve
Well begun is half done
Well done is better than well said
What cannot be cured must be endured
What does not kill me makes me stronger
What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
What is learnt in the cradle lasts to the tombs
What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander
What is the worst that can happen?
What the eye does not see (the heart does not grieve over)
What the eye does not see, the heart does not grieve over
What you lose on the swings you gain on the roundabouts
Whatever floats your boat
When hell freezes over
When in Rome do as the Romans do
When it rains it pours
When life gives you lemons, make lemonade
When pigs fly
When the cat is away, the mice will play
When the going gets tough, the tough get going
When the oak is before the ash, then you will only get a splash; when the ash is before the oak, then you may expect a soak
When you have seen one, you have seen them all
Where there is a will there is a way
Where there is life there is hope
Where there is muck there is brass
Where there's smoke, there's fire
Whether you think you can or you think you can't, you're right
While there is life there is hope
Who will bell the cat?
Whom the Gods love die young
[[Don't keep a dog and bark yourself,Why keep a dog and bark yourself?]]
Wild goose chase
With great power comes great responsibility
Woe to the vanquished
Woman is the root of both good and evil
Wonders will never cease
Word of mouth
Work expands so as to fill the time available
Worrying never did anyone any good
You are >Here<
[[You are n,N]]ever too old to learn
You are what you eat
You can have too much of a good thing
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink
You [[can never,never can]] tell
You can't have it both ways
You can't have your cake and eat it too
[[Don't,Never,You can't]] judge a book by its cover
You can't teach an old dog new tricks
You can't win [['em,them]] all
You cannot always get what you want
You cannot burn a candle at both ends
You cannot get blood out of a stone
You cannot make a silk purse from a sow's ear
You cannot make bricks without straw
You cannot push a rope
You cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hounds
You cannot unscramble eggs
You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain
You get what you pay for
You [[may,might as well]] be [[hanged,hung]] for a sheep as (for) a lamb
You must have rocks in your head
You only live once
You pay your dime and you takes your chances
You pay your money and you take your choice
You reap what you sow
You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours
you sly dog
You'll never get if you never go
You're never fully dressed without a smile
[[You're :1,:5]]on thin ice
You're toast
You've got to separate the wheat from the chaff
You've made your bed and you must lie [[in,on]] it
Your guess is as good as mine
Youth is wasted on the young
Zeal without knowledge is fire without light
Zero tolerance
