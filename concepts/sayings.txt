[[He's,She's,You're,They're]] outta there!
[[I'm,We're]] outta here!
[[Settle,Settles,Settling]] the score
[[We're,I'm]] safe
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
A blessing in disguise
A cut above
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link
A day late and a dollar short
A dime a dozen
Book it
A friend in need is a friend indeed
A leopard can't change its spots
A penny saved is a penny earned
A picture is worth a thousand words
A picture paints a thousand words
A rolling stone gathers no moss
A stitch in time saves nine
A watched pot never boils
A wolf in sheep's clothing
Absence of malice
Actions speak louder than words
All bark and no bite
All for one and one for all
All good things must come to an end
All roads lead to Rome
All systems go
All that glitters is not gold
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy
All's fair in love and war
All's lost
All's not lost
All's well that ends well
As a matter of course
As a matter of fact
An apple a day keeps the doctor away
An eye for an eye
As cool as a cucumber
At the drop of a hat
Back to square one
Barking up the wrong tree
Beat a dead horse
Beat around the bush
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Beauty is only skin deep
Beggars can't be choosers
Better late than never
Better safe than sorry
Better the devil you know
Better to be alone than in bad company
Better to have loved and lost
Between a rock and a hard place
Big fish in a small pond
Birds of a feather flock together
Bite off more than you can chew
Bite the bullet
Bite your tongue
Blood is thicker than water
Break a leg
Break the bank
Break the ice
Burn bridges
Burn the midnight oil
By hook or by crook
By the skin of your teeth
Call it a day
Call it quits
Can't make an omelet without breaking eggs
Catch-22
Catch my drift
Chekhov's Gun
Close but no cigar
Come rain or shine
Cost an arm and a leg
Cry wolf
Curiosity killed the cat
Cut corners
Cut through the red tape
Cut to the chase
Devil's advocate
Don't bite the hand that feeds you
Don't count your chickens before they hatch
Don't cry over spilled milk
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Don't put the cart before the horse
Don't rock the boat
Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater
Down to earth
Draw the line
Drop in the bucket
Early to bed, early to rise
Easy as ABC
Easy as pie
Easy come, easy go
Easy does it
Every cloud has a silver lining
Every dog has its day
Every man for himself
Face the music
Fair and square
fall out of favor
Fight fire with fire
Feeling a bit rusty
Find your feet
Fine by me
Fish out of water
Fit as a fiddle
Fly on the wall
For the birds
Fortune favors the bold
Fortune favors the brave
Fortune smiles on the brave
from the get-go
Get a grip
Get a taste of your own medicine
Get cold feet
Get out of hand
Get the ball rolling
Get your act together
Get the point
Gilding the lily
Give it a shot
Give it to me straight
Give someone the benefit of the doubt
Give the cold shoulder
Giving it the old college try
Go against the grain
Go back to the drawing board
Go down in flames
Go the extra mile
Go with the flow
Good things come to those who wait
Green with envy
Haste makes waste
Have a bone to pick
Hear me out
Have a heart
Have your head in the clouds
Head over heels
Hedging [[my,your,his,her,our,their]] bets
Hit the nail on the head
Hit the road
Hit the sack
Hold your horses
How it panned put
I'm all ears
I'm having a whale of a time
I'm in a pickle
I'm stumped
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
If the cap fits, wear it
If the shoe fits, wear it
If wishes were horses, beggars would ride
If you can't beat them, join them
If you play with fire, you'll get burned
If you want something done right, do it yourself
Ignorance is bliss
In a nutshell
In hot water
In over [[[my,your,his,her] head,[our,their] heads]]
In the same boat
Ironing it out
It goes without saying
It takes a village
It takes two to tango
It's a piece of cake
It's a small world
It's all Greek to me
It's always darkest before the dawn
It's never too late
It's not rocket science
It's raining cats and dogs
It's the thought that counts
Jack of all trades, master of none
Jump on the bandwagon
Jump the gun
Just winging it
Keep it under your hat
Keep your chin up
Keep your eyes peeled
Keep your secrets
Kick the bucket
Kill two birds with one stone
Knock on wood
Know the ropes
Last straw
Laugh all the way to the bank
Laughter is the best medicine
Leave no stone unturned
Let bygones be bygones
Let sleeping dogs lie
Let the cat out of the bag
Let the chips fall where they may
Let's get this straight
Lightning never strikes twice
Like a fish out of water
Like two peas in a pod
Live and learn
Long story short
Look before you leap
Love is in the air
make a beeline for
Make a long story short
Make a mountain out of a molehill
Make ends meet
Make hay while the sun shines
Make or break
Method to the madness
Mind your own business
Miss the boat
Miss the mark
More than meets the eye
Necessity is the mother of invention
Needle in a haystack
Never say never
No news is good news
No bones about it
No cap
No pain, no gain
No strings attached
No way no how
Not my cup of tea
Not so fast!
Not so sure
Off the beaten path
Off the top of my head
Old as the hills
On cloud nine
On pins and needles
On the ball
On thin ice
Once bitten, twice shy
Once in a blue moon
Once in a blue moon
Once in a lifetime
One man's trash is another man's treasure
Out of left field
Out of sight, out of mind
Out of the blue
Out of the frying pan into the fire
Over the moon
Paint the town red
Pass the buck
Pay the piper
Penny for your thoughts
Piece of cake
Play it by ear
Play your cards right
Point of no return
Pot calling the kettle black
Practice makes perfect
Practice what you preach
Pull someone's leg
Pull strings
Pull yourself together
put a lid on it
Put all your cards on the table
Put your foot in your mouth
Put your money where your mouth is
Read between the lines
Ready or not, here I come
Red herring
Right off the bat
Ring a bell
Rise and shine
Rolling in the deep
Rome wasn't built in a day
Rule of thumb
Run circles around
Running in place
Saved by the bell
Scratch the surface
See eye to eye
See the light
Shoot the breeze
Sit tight
Sixth sense
Smell a rat
Smooth sailing
So far so good
so long to $$random_word
Somehow or other
Speak of the devil
Spill the beans
Start from scratch
Steal someone's thunder
Stick to your guns
Storm in a teacup
Straight from the horse's mouth
Take a rain check
Take it with a grain of salt
Take the bull by the horns
That is to say
That settles that
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree
The ball is in your court
The ball's in your court
The best of both worlds
The best things in life are free
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
The customer is always right
The devil is in the details
The die is cast
The early bird catches the worm
The early bird gets the worm
The elephant in the room
The ends justify the means
The exception proves the rule
The grass is always greener on the other side
The last laugh
The last straw
The more the merrier
The pen is mightier than the sword
The pot calling the kettle black
The proof is in the pudding
The show must go on
The squeaky wheel gets the grease
The whole nine yards
The writing is on the wall
There's more than one way to skin a cat
There's no such thing as a free lunch
Think nothing of it
Think outside the box
Through thick and thin
Throw caution to the wind
Throw in the towel
Time flies when you're having fun
Time heals all wounds
Time is money
Tip of the iceberg
To each his own
To make matters worse
Tongue in cheek
Too close for comfort
Too good to be true
Too many cooks spoil the broth
Turn a blind eye
Turn over a new leaf
Two can play at that game
Two heads are better than one
Two wrongs don't make a right
Two's company, three's a crowd
Under the weather
Up in arms
Up to scratch
Up to snuff
Use your head
Vanish into thin air
Variety is the spice of life
Wait and see
Wake up and smell the coffee
Walk on eggshells
Water under the bridge
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it
Wear your heart on your sleeve
What goes around comes around
When hell freezes over
When it rains, it pours
When pigs fly
Where there's smoke, there's fire
Wild goose chase
Word of mouth
You are >Here<
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink
You can't have it both ways
You can't have your cake and eat it too
You can't judge a book by its cover
You can't teach an old dog new tricks
You can't win them all
You get what you pay for
You reap what you sow
You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours
you sly dog
You're on thin ice
You're toast
Your guess is as good as mine
Zero tolerance
