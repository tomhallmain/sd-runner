A matter of chorus
A real pane in the glass
A-peeling work
All in vein
Bass-ically perfect
Be-leaf it or not
Bear with me
Bearly there
Bee yourself
Bread winner
Can't be-leaf my eyes
Can't elope with that
Cheese the moment
Chick magnet
Claws for concern
Cloud you be more specific
Deer me
Don't be shellfish
Don't be so shellfish
Don't go bacon my heart
Donut worry
Eggs-actly right
Ewe got to be kidding
Eye can see clearly now
Feta late than never
For peat's sake
Fries before guys
Fur real
Give me a brake
Good gourd
Gouda vibes only
Grate expectations
Hair today, gone tomorrow
Honey, I'm home
I'm board
I'm board of this
I'm feeling a bit horse
I'm feeling grape
I'm having a fang-tastic time
I'm having a gouda time
I'm not kitten around
I'm not lion
It's a fowl day
It's knot what you think
It's nacho problem
It's snow joke
Ketchup with me
Knight time
Let's taco 'bout it
Lettuce celebrate
Make like a tree and leaf
Mind your peas and queues
Moo-ving right along
No more apostrophes
No whey
Olive you
On cloud wine
Owl be seeing you
Owl's well that ends well
Pasta la vista
Paws and reflect
Paws for thought
Pizza my mind
Reindeer games
Seal the deal
Sole searching
Soy happy
That's a load of croc
That's a wrap
That's a-maze-ing
That's a-moo-sing
That's a-peel-ing
That's berry nice
That's egg-cellent
That's lit dawg
That's owl-right
That's tree-mendous
That's un-bee-lievable
That's wheely good
Time to turnip the heat
Tofu much fun
Whale done
Wool you marry me
Yak about it
